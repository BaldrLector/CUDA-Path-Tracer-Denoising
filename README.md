## Overview
Physically based monte-carlo path tracing can produce photo-realistc rendering of computer graphics scenes. However, even with today's hardware it is impossible to converge a scene quickly and meet the performance requirement for real-time interactive application such as games. To bring path tracing to real-time, we reduce sample counts per pixel to 1 and apply post-processing to eliminate noise.

*Signal processing* and *Accumulation* are two major techniques of denosing. Signal processing techniques blur out noise by applying spatial filters or machine learning to the output; Accumulation techniques make it possible to reuse samples in a moving scene by associating pixel between frames. *Spatio-Temporal Variance Guided Filter* [Schied 2017] combines these two techniques and enables high quaility real-time path tracing for dynamic scenes.

### Path Tracing

### Temporal Accumulation
In order to reuse samples from the previous frame, we reproject the sample to its prior frame and calculate its screen space coordinate. This is completed in the following steps:
1. Find world space position of the current frame in G-buffer. 
2. Transform from current world space to the previous clip space using the stored camera view matrix.
3. Transform from previous clip space to previous screen space using perspective projection.
